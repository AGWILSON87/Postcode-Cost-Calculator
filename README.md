# Postcode-Cost-Calculator
A delivery cost calculator using Google Maps API

My first ever project, I will attempt to use/learn HTML,CSS and Javascript. 
It will calculate the cost of delivery to a specific postcode using the distance matrix tool. 



Type in Postcode and find how much it will cost to deliver there. 

Using the VMI delivery costs: 

Delivery/Collection within 5 miles:    £30.00

Delivery/Collection within 7.5 miles: £45.00

Delivery/Collection within 10 miles:  £50.00

Delivery/Collection within 15 miles:  £60.00

Delivery/Collection within 25 miles:  £70.00

Delivery/Collection over 25 miles (national): £1 per mile (based on round trip 40 Miles +)
